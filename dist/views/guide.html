<div class="text-page-wrapper"> <h1>Guide</h1> <h3>Summary View Page</h3> <p>A separate table is provided for each of the five consumer segments and can be changed using the dropdown selection at the top of the page.</p> <p>Rank: The themes in each consumer segment are ranked from top to bottom according to its placement amongst all LEGO themes according to overall positive sentiment.</p> <p>Comparison to LEGO Average: This column tells the overall sentiment of this theme compared to overall sentiment of all other themes.</p> <p>Positive Drivers: The top one-three factors that Luminoso has identified as drivers of positive sentiment in this theme are shown ranked from left to right.</p> <p>Negative Drivers: Similarly, the top one-three factors that Luminoso has identified as drivers of negative sentiment in this theme are shown ranked from left to right.</p> <h3>LEGO Scorecard Page</h3> <p>The topics on the left and the column headers are consistent across each monthly scorecard.</p> <p>Rows: Each row represents a possible topic that is discussed by reviewers. By hovering over a topic, you can see the keywords attributed to it.</p> <p>Several topics (i.e. Educational Value, Instructions, Price, Packaging, Delivery, and Gift) have indented sub-topics below them that provide a deeper breakdown of the broader topic. The broad topic reveals any discussion about that topic, while the sub-topic precisely measures various sentiment or detail within that discussion.</p> <p>Columns: Columns provide understanding about the different experiences between the various groups of customers or toys. The “All LEGO” column represents all reviews of all products. The retailer columns represent which store the product was originally purchased at.</p> <p>By hovering over a column header, you can see certain quantitative information about the group: the percentage of reviews it makes up in its category (Consumer Segments, Retail Channel, Consumer Sentiment, or All Product Themes) and a trendline for how the amount of reviews has changed month to month.</p> <p>Toggle button: Numerical values are displayed by default and can be hidden by clicking the “Toggle Scores” checkbox in the top right. The colors-only view is recommend for getting a quicker, more intuitive understanding of the scorecard.</p> <p>Colors: The shading of the cells tells how prominently a topic is being discussed in a given group. The colors range from white (low discussion volume) to darker blue (high discusion volume).</p> <p>Values: The numerical values are directly related to the coloring of the cells. They indicate how often a given topic (row) is being discussed in the reviews by a given group (column). The values range from -1 to 1. The higher the number, the more discussion in that group about that topic.</p> <p>Values are most useful for viewing and comparing columns across one row (or topic).</p> <h3>Mega Bloks Scorecard Page</h3> <p>This scorecard is designed and may be understood in the same way as the LEGO scorecard.</p> </div>
