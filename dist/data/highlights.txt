Here are some things we noticed this month:
Reviewers on Toys “R” Us and Amazon tend to speak most positively of LEGO products compared to other retailers.  For Toys "R" Us, this is driven by higher perceived value, whereas for Amazon positive sentiment is driven by a positive delivery experience.  
Collectors tend to go to the LEGO Store and Target to purchase the sets they want, while people shopping for gifts go to Toys "R" Us, Amazon, and Walmart.
Of the retail channels analyzed, the LEGO Store performs less well than its competitors.  Price, especially as pertains to sets being expensive, is more frequently mentioned in LEGO Store reviews than reviews for other retailers. 
Packaging is typically only discussed when there is problem, such as being flimsy or damaged.  Negative mentions of packaging are driven by a few specific themes: the LEGO Movie, Technic, LEGO Friends, City, and Creator.  
While LEGOs are considered expensive, this is not in and of itself a bad thing. People who leave high ratings mention that the sets are expensive, but consider them to be worth it.  A lack of perceived value drives poor ratings. 
Relative to all LEGO themes, those designed for the 12+ consumer segment do not perform as well.  These themes are all considered to be fun, but less fun than themes for other consumer segments.  In addition, people mention missing pieces more often for these themes, though it is important to note that missing pieces are not mentioned often.
